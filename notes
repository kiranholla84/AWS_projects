Note to the user

o	Project Workflow

Yahoo API -> EC2 -> Kinesis -> Lambda ->SNS & DynamoDB

o	Manual AWS actions required prior to running the script 
(If you do not want to do this , look at my other project Stock_price_anomaly_yfinance_python_aws_cloudformation"

- Create EC2 linux instance and install python, yfinance, pandas
- Create basic kinesis stream of 1 shard
- Copy the StockPriceInjestion.py into the EC2 machine and ensure it runs
- Create role for EC2 in AWS to talk with Kinesis
- Create role for Lambda in AWS to talk with Kinesis, SNS, DynamoDB
- Create lambda function and copy the content of lambda_function.py into the created lambda function
- Add trigger as Kinesis for Lambda function
- Create an SNS subscription and dynamoDB table as mentioned in the script lambda_function.py
- Observe the anomaly data coming into your email (via SNS) and getting populated in the dynamoDB table

o	The script StockpriceInjestion does the below for you

> Extracts historical finance data using python and yahoo finance API in EC2
> Cleans and formatted the data using Pandas
> Streams data to AWS streaming solution â€“ Kinesis

o	The script lambda_function.py does the below
> Python code to detect anomalies
> Notification of anomalies to user using SNS 
> Addition of anomaly data into AWS dynamo DB
